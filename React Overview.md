# Component-Based Architecture

## Question
What is the main purpose of React’s component-based architecture?

## Answer
It allows building reusable, self-contained UI pieces that handle their own logic and presentation, promoting maintainability and scalability.

# Declarative Programming Paradigm

## Question
How does React’s declarative approach differ from imperative programming?

## Answer
Declarative code describes what the UI should look like for a given state, while imperative code specifies how to change the DOM step by step.

# State-Driven UI Architecture

## Question
How does React ensure predictable UI updates using state?

## Answer
React re-renders components automatically when state changes, maintaining unidirectional data flow for predictable and consistent updates.

# JavaScript Library Architecture

## Question
Why is React considered a library and not a framework?

## Answer
React focuses only on the view layer, allowing developers to choose their own tools for routing, state management, and other app features.

# Industry Adoption & Ecosystem

## Question
Why is React widely adopted across the tech industry?

## Answer
Its performance, strong community, enterprise backing, and flexible ecosystem make it ideal for scalable and maintainable frontend development.

# Meta Engineering & Open Source

## Question
How did React’s open-source nature contribute to its success?

## Answer
React evolved through Meta’s engineering support and community contributions, leading to continuous innovation and global developer adoption.
